## 1152 Google Recruitment (20分)

In July 2004, Google posted on a giant billboard along Highway 101 in Silicon Valley (shown in the picture below) for recruitment. The content is super-simple, a URL consisting of the first 10-digit prime found in consecutive digits of the natural constant *e*. The person who could find this prime number could go to the next step in Google's hiring process by visiting this website.

The natural constant *e* is a well known transcendental number（超越数）. The first several digits are: *e* = 2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995957496696762772407663035354759457138217852516642**7427466391**932003059921... where the 10 digits in bold are the answer to Google's question.

Now you are asked to solve a more general problem: find the first K-digit prime in consecutive digits of any given L-digit number.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case first gives in a line two positive integers: L (≤ 1,000) and K (< 10), which are the numbers of digits of the given number and the prime to be found, respectively. Then the L-digit number N is given in the next line.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in a line the first K-digit prime in consecutive digits of N. If such a number does not exist, output `404` instead. Note: the leading zeroes must also be counted as part of the K digits. For example, to find the 4-digit prime in 200236, 0023 is a solution. However the first digit 2 must not be treated as a solution 0002 since the leading zeroes are not in the original number.

### Sample Input 1:

```in
20 5
23654987725541023819
```

### Sample Output 1:

```out
49877
```

### Sample Input 2:

```in
10 3
2468024680
```

### Sample Output 2:

```out
404
```

### Explaining

从所给序列中找出符合题目要求的质数

### Thinking

将序列存储为string类型，通过string转化为int，判断数字是否为质数，判断成功输出，判断失败404

### Code

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

bool isPrim(int n)
{
	for (int i = 2; i < sqrt(n); i++)
	{
		if (n % i == 0)
			return false;
	}
	return true;
}
int main()
{
	int n, k;
	cin >> n >> k;
	string number;
	cin >> number;

	for (int i = 0; i < n - k + 1; i++)
	{
		string sub = number.substr(i, k);
		int subNum = stoi(sub);
		if (isPrim(subNum))
		{
			cout << sub << endl;
			return 0;
		}
	}
	cout << 404;
	return 0;
}
```



## 1153 Decode Registration Card of PAT (25分)

A registration card number of PAT consists of 4 parts:

- the 1st letter represents the test level, namely, `T` for the top level, `A` for advance and `B` for basic;
- the 2nd - 4th digits are the test site number, ranged from 101 to 999;
- the 5th - 10th digits give the test date, in the form of `yymmdd`;
- finally the 11th - 13th digits are the testee's number, ranged from 000 to 999.

Now given a set of registration card numbers and the scores of the card owners, you are supposed to output the various statistics according to the given queries.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives two positive integers *N* (≤104) and *M* (≤100), the numbers of cards and the queries, respectively.

Then *N* lines follow, each gives a card number and the owner's score (integer in [0,100]), separated by a space.

After the info of testees, there are *M* lines, each gives a query in the format `Type Term`, where

- `Type` being 1 means to output all the testees on a given level, in non-increasing order of their scores. The corresponding `Term` will be the letter which specifies the level;
- `Type` being 2 means to output the total number of testees together with their total scores in a given site. The corresponding `Term` will then be the site number;
- `Type` being 3 means to output the total number of testees of every site for a given test date. The corresponding `Term` will then be the date, given in the same format as in the registration card.

### Output Specification:

For each query, first print in a line `Case #: input`, where `#` is the index of the query case, starting from 1; and `input` is a copy of the corresponding input query. Then output as requested:

- for a type 1 query, the output format is the same as in input, that is, `CardNumber Score`. If there is a tie of the scores, output in increasing alphabetical order of their card numbers (uniqueness of the card numbers is guaranteed);
- for a type 2 query, output in the format `Nt Ns` where `Nt` is the total number of testees and `Ns` is their total score;
- for a type 3 query, output in the format `Site Nt` where `Site` is the site number and `Nt` is the total number of testees at `Site`. The output must be in non-increasing order of `Nt`'s, or in increasing order of site numbers if there is a tie of `Nt`.

If the result of a query is empty, simply print `NA`.

### Sample Input:

```in
8 4
B123180908127 99
B102180908003 86
A112180318002 98
T107150310127 62
A107180908108 100
T123180908010 78
B112160918035 88
A107180908021 98
1 A
2 107
3 180908
2 999
```

### Sample Output:

```out
Case 1: 1 A
A107180908108 100
A107180908021 98
A112180318002 98
Case 2: 2 107
3 260
Case 3: 3 180908
107 2
123 2
102 1
Case 4: 2 999
NA
```

### Explaining

PAT考号信息由四个部分组成：

第一位 代表考试等级

第二到第四位 代表考场号101-999

第五到第十位 代表当前日期 yymmdd

第十一到底十三 代表考生号码 000-999

查询代号：

1 表示考试等级 查询结果为考号+分数

2 表示考场号 查询结果为考生总数+总分

3 表示日期 查询结果为考场号+ 考场人数

没有结果输出NA

### Thinking

做一个结构体，里面每个成员分别作为map的key

### Code
